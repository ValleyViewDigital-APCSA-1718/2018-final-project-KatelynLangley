   The game that I want to create for my final, is a text adventure, like the old Zork games. But, the twist I want to have, and story I 
want to convey, is going to be like an escape room. Most text adventures you have to think about where and what you want and have to look 
at, but also mainly use your imagination, which could go well for a mystery game as well.

  The player will be able to use the commands “go”, “look”, “take”, “use”, “open”, and “close”. I will also create “inventory”, which will 
allow the player to look at the items that they have already taken, and are currently in their possession. It will be a single player game,
but it would have to be played in one sitting. By using the items they pick up throughout the game, they’ll be able to go further and 
further into the room, and eventually escape if enough clues and tools are used and found.

  The premise of the game will be you woke up in what looks like someone’s room, but the door is locked. You have to find a way out,
and through your search, you find the horrors of the place you woke up in.
